# Story: As a programmer, I can tell which model year a vehicle is from. Model years never change. Hint: Make model year part of the initialization.

# Story: As a programmer, I can turn on and off the lights on a given Vehicle. Hint: Create method(s) to allow programmer to turn lights on and off. Which class are the methods in?
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can determine if the lights are on or off. Lights start in the off position.
#
# You should be able to test the car now:
# vehicle = Vehicle.new(...)
# vehicle.lights_on # should return false because they start false
# vehicle.lights_on = true # this should change the lights to true
# vehicle.lights_on # should now return true
# vehicle.lights_on = false # this should change the lights to false
# vehicle.lights_on? # should return false
# Story: As a programmer, I can signal left and right. Turn signals starts off.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can determine the speed of a car. Speed starts at 0 km/h.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can speed my Teslas up by 10 per acceleration.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can slow my Teslas down by 7 per braking.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can speed my Hondas up by 2 per acceleration.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can slow my Hondas down by 1.25 per braking.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can speed my Toyotas up by 7 per acceleration.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can slow my Toyotas down by 5 per braking.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can call upon a car to tell me all it's information. Hint: Implement to_s on one or more classes. You can call a super class's to_s with super.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can keep a collection of two of each kind of vehicle, all from different years. Hint: Create two of each vehicles, all from different model years, and put them into an Array.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model year.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model. Hint: Sort based on class name.
#
# Story: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model and then year. Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.
